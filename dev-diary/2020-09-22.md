# Bootstrap Budget! Dev Diary: Sprint 1

It’s been two whole weeks now. I forgot to mention in my first post that I plan on either making a diary entry every two weeks, or having two week sprints. It looks like I’m already a day late on that, so I’m off to a great start :-P

These past two weeks have mostly been spent on research and thinking about the requirements. I’ve also managed to put a little work into setting up a test environment.

## Some Requirements

For my requirements, here is what I have so far. All of it is mostly on the technical side for right now:
- Linux hosted (preferably Debian or Ubuntu)
- Apache 2.4.x HTTP Service
- Utilizes Bootstrap 4 as the front-end framework (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)
	- Funny story: this is partially how Bootstrap Budget got its name
- Node.js 12.x for backend API
	- Express framework
- MySQL (or equivalent eg. MariaDB or Amazon Aurora)

In my first entry, I laid out some of the basic high-level requirements for the service—primarily that it should eventually live in AWS. In the long-run I would like for it to be configurable and for the ability to be hosted locally.
  
Over the next two weeks I plan on spending more time learning in depth about these services and frameworks. I already have a decent amount of base knowledge as a start.

## The Groundwork
Since hosting on AWS can incur some costs, I’m going to use a personal server that I’m hosting at home as my testing environment. It’s not exactly a powerhouse, but it’s nearly equivalent to any micro instance you could create on AWS or Google Cloud:
- AMD Turion 64 X2 (1.6GHz)
- 2GB Ram
- 130GB HDD

On this server I have the following services running to match those current technical requirements:
- Debian Linux 9 (Stretch)
- Apache 2.4.25
- Node.js v12.18.4
- MariaDB v10.1.45

Soon after my first entry I also decided to snag the domain name through AWS Route 53. Since I’m planning to host it on AWS anyway this should make it easier when the time comes to create hosted zones and route traffic to the Linux instance (which I’ll create later.) I’ve done this before and it’s surprisingly easy.

Since college, I’ve used Apache to play around with hosting my own web service as well as mocking up small sites as I tried to re-learn HTML or JavaScript. But until now I hadn’t really played around with creating virtual hosts. There have been a handful of applications I’ve hosted in the past. This was a good time to learn how to host individual sites properly. With what I learned, I was able to set up the [main site](http://kryten.blakephillips.info/) for the test box, a [bootstrap budget](http://kryten.blakephillips.info/bootstrapbudget/) path and a few other paths for hosting [Codiad](http://codiad.com/) (a web-based IDE) and CGI scripts (Python). I’m pretty happy with the result:

I also learned that, with AWS, you can set up simple redirects using S3 buckets. It’s not quite as simple though. I wasn’t able to get it working (yet). I do plan to make it a goal to temporarily redirect the actual domain name with the dyn address to my local server. I’ll outline more of that once I have it working.

## Next Sprint: Continue Environment Setup and User Stories / Wireframes


For my next sprint, I’m going to continue setting up my testing environment and start walking through a base-line of what functionality I want to have before I do eventually deploy to AWS. I’ve already spent some time re-creating accounts for my MariaDB service and intend to create one specifically for the bootstrap budget API to use. I may reach out to a few friends for help with this to keep my thoughts on track. It’s easy to get distracted from the main goals of the week and end up chasing down something shiny instead.

Overall, I think I’m still off to a good start. This week I’m on PTO, so that should help :-)
