# Bootstrap Budget! Dev Diary: Project Start

Last year I decided to challenge myself by creating a command-line resistor calculator called [ResistCalc-CLI](https://github.com/baphil8649/ResistCalc-CLI). This was after re-learning Java and it was a similar project I did for a course in college.

  
This year I decided to refresh my learning on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Recently, with the help of a friend from work as well as through various tutorials, I have learned other languages such as Kotlin, Python and Node.js. Today, in an effort to challenge myself once again and go to the next level of creating a full-blown cloud service using Amazon Web Services (AWS), I am starting a new development project called Bootstrap Budget!

## Current State: Google Sheets Budgets
Around the end of 2014 I had an epiphany: I was tired of paying my student loans and not really knowing where my money was going. Being in my mid-20s and single, I didn’t have a budget other than “try not to spend money on things I don’t need.” I was paying a little more than the minimum on things like my car payment and student loans. They were the only major debt I had at the time, but added up to around $20,000. So for 2015 I decided that I would try budgeting and develop my own system so that I’d be more engaged with it. It was actually more or less like keeping a checkbook than an actual budget, but it was a start. Using Google Sheets I would log some high-level totals by grouping things together in order to trace where I spent the most money and projecting what I would spend through-out the year to determine how much I would have left over. It was eye-opening and motivated me to restructure my spending so that I could put more towards debt and reduce elsewhere.

It’s five years later and I am still using Google Sheets. The way I layout my high-level and grouped items has evolved greatly. It has gotten more complicated since getting married and consequently we need to track how much we spend vs. how much we’ll have left over to eliminate debt. Below is a very small example of what it looks like today.

## Future State: Moving to the Cloud (again)
Similar to my epiphany in late 2014 I am having a new one now: I’m tired of budgeting with spreadsheets. As much as I still enjoy keeping track of our budget, it’s more tedious than fun. And with everything I’ve learned in the last year, I should have the tools to make it better.

Starting today, I want to make a new way to track my spending. Specifically, I want a way to upload our monthly statements into a database, normalize it, and analyze where our money is going each month while also projecting future months. I also want that solution in the cloud so that my wife and I can both use it. And to be honest, I want to do something fun and show off my engineering skillz :-P

At this moment I have decided on the following high-level goals for the project:

 1. Develop my Bootstrap Budget! application using AWS services
	 a. An [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) Linux instance with Apache HTTP for delivering a front-end
	 b.  [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function(s) as my API service between the front-end and database
	 c. And an RDS instance of Amazon’s [Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/)
 2.  Keep a bi-weekly dev diary for tracking my progress through each sprint and writing down moments of success, frustration, failure and confusion. I’m going to play this by ear and try not to get wrapped up in giving too much information that might take away from development.

Below is a basic diagram I’ve created to express #1. #2 will obviously be represented by this first entry in the diary.

## Next Steps: Sprints! and Expectations

The next step in the master plan is to start outlining sprints. If it’s not obvious, I’ve already done a lot of thinking about this project—enough to make a diagram (which means I’m taking it seriously at this point).I want to be as agile as possible, but I also don’t want to set myself up for failure trying to manage too much. For anyone watching the project closely, I want to set the expectation that this is not going to be a perfect picture for how any development project should go. There’s a possibility that one or two months from now I will put the project on hold or give-up completely depending on outside circumstances. That’s why I’ve chosen to keep a dev diary to add a little more accountability and motivation to write the next one.

In a couple of weeks, I should have an even greater idea of how I want to proceed as well as the detailed set of steps I want to take to make things work. I hope this is as fun as I think it’s going to be.
